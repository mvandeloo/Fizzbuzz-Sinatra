Fizzbuzz_Sinatra Exercise (exercise was made mid of September)

About the project:

For practicing Sinatra I made a web version of The Fizzbuzz game (a previous exercise we have made at Makersacademy for practicing Ruby). The rules of the game can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz.
